a very underrated volume for me. this might be a little controversial but i enjoyed it more than most of the other y1 volumes. i thought the class expulsion voting system was another great idea for an exam and really fleshed out characters like Horikita and Hirata.  one of my favourite moments in the whole series was Hirata snapping after Horikita accusing Yamauchi of conspiring with class A. it was such a tense moment and really captured the intensity of the exam and how difficult and unfair it is.  then there was Horikita and her development. I’ve always been a Horikita fan coz I hard ship her and ayano (i’m aware it wont happen let me live in denial). I like her trying to repair her relationship with Manabu before he graduated and seeing her big speech in front of the class was an amazing development from how she acted in the earlier volumes.  I genuinely hope we get to see more of Koenji because I think he could have been in a lot of trouble if it wasn’t for Horikita. I did respect him taking all of the heat for Yamauchi tho.  and for once in my life i actually predicted what ayano would do with ryuuens private points i was actually proud of myslef for being right.  AND YET AGAIN absolutely fuck alll Kei. For the last idk how many volumes she’s been so quiet ig the last volume she was useful in baiting out Hashimoto but i really don’t enjoy how they are just making her character the one that helps the mc for 5 minutes and then dips. i hope this is changed in future volumes.  I just read a volume 11 review who said that volume 11 was the best one he’s read so far so i’m excited to see that fs.
"alking about demon slayer here (mainly its fandom) but also anime in general and the way japan is excused to be this magic little fairyland country where nothing bad ever happens EVER.  One of the side(? I think, idk if giyuu tomioka is considered a side character or not) litterly picked his colleague up (shinobu kocho) in one of the episodes and SPANKED HER. Yet NOBODY cares about that or if your mad about it because ""wEll it wAs iN tHe tAisho ErA sO yoU cAnT coMplAin!!"" Yet she lightly teases him a few times and so many people hate on her and calls her names and shit  ETA: Disregard this little section ^ up here because it wasnt apart of the show and instead an edit of him spanking her. My memory is a little bad.  One of the characters (tengen uzui) litterly said she has hips perfect for birthing and nobody gives a shit. He also picked up a 16 yr old girl and spanked her for no fucking reason?? Im so fucking done with anime y'all. Tengens 23 btw. Like how are people supposed to NOT find him weird after that? This fandom and other anime fandoms PISS ME OFF SO BAD. Done with anime because this shit makes me mad.  And yes, i know its fictional. It just pisses me off alot how many weird ass things get excused in anime AND THEIR FANDOMS.  ETA 2: The reason why i ranted about this was because of the misogyny and sexualness in anime, which is why i shared it here since anime has a sexualization problem and hentai is also a horrible thing. I just feel like i wanted to explain myself so people dont think im trying to be off topic in the subreddit or anything."
"There actually are some anime with girls/women as the lead character that doesn't sexually exploit them. I'm also trying to avoid series/movies that are straight up romance-based but hard to find things with absolutely zero % romance.  Kiki's Delivery Service It's by Studio Ghibli which has a decent reputation with female leads that actually do something. A young witch decides to leave home and uses her flying abilities to run a delivery service  Spirited Away A young girl's parents get turned into pigs and has to navigate the spirit world to get them back.  Ascendance of a Bookworm (current anime seasons only) A young woman in our world who loves books gets reincarnated in a medieval world where she's born a peasant but has a lot of mana and tries to use her previous knowledge to get into a position where she can both read and buy books. Top notch world building. (I say current anime seasons only because it's based on a ton of books that have yet to be animated)  Aria the Animation is on youtube and free so you can check it out for yourself. It's basically set on Mars and there is a city called New Venice. A girl goes there to be a tour guide on a gondola. Fun slice of life and most of the cast is girls/women. Most of the interactions are between the female gondoliers and/or their passengers.  Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Lead is a thousand year old elf who was part of a hero's party but most of the party has aged and died. It does a really good job at how a comparatively immortal person would feel about her friendships with much shorter-lived people. She also kicks ass, has an apprentice named Fern, etc. it does have a subplot where she regrets not having pursued something more with Himmel, a member of the previous party, but also references her former master, a woman named Flame, often.  Anime with male leads but the series does not poop on women  Natsume's Book of Friends Natsume is a boy who can see spirits/monsters and was often bullied for seeing things nobody else can see. The series often references his grandmother in her youth who had the same powers but was even stronger when it came to fighting spirits. He's actually empathetic even towards spirits/monsters that attack him. He himself is not romantically involved with anybody but has girls who are friends. No harem collecting going on.  I can recommend more if you like."
"I promise you that whilst you won't finish a book and all of a sudden be a master of your problems, you will certainly be better equipped with the tools and knowledge in order to navigate through your problems and eventually conquer them  I've met a large amount of people (irl and this sub) looking to be diagnosed with some sort of disorder so they have an excuse for why their lives are going the way they are when they just have 'I haven't picked up a book disorder'  It sounds obvious but, just read books."
"That is a good reason to read books.  Here are a few more:  Books will help you train focus and discipline. It is more work than watching a video, and improves your patience and resilience. If you summarize it (yourself), you train your intellect even more.  Books can help you train your imagination, and get out of the trap of corporate-produced fantasies.  Books are the only way to truly connect to the past. A connection that gets sadly lost as a lot of people simply denigrate everything before 1990 because it doesn't sit well with their moral and political sensibilities."
"So. You could basically just murder everyone like Light did and never make a post or something about it. Like, don't give yourself a moniker or make it a message or tell anyone about it.  And they'd never figure that shit out. Ever.  I'm pretty sure even the NSA, FBI, And CIA don't have the power to tell whose currently writing what in a notebook. And why'd they'd think a couple hundred thousand people are dying from heart attacks from a magical death book and not because they ate McDonald's once that week would be a jump. Like the news wouldn't be 'Magical killer' it'd be 'Mcnuggies kill a 100k'  Go home. Get into a chair. write 100 names a day. And you'd basically just eventually end a nation or something."
"I'm a pretty big fan of MHA. I started reading after the fourth season aired, as I couldn't wait a year for the story to continue. There's a lot of things to criticize the series, clearly. You can't really have a good opinion on a series without being able to criticize something the series does wrong. Here, I'd like to do that with the series' second worst handled character.  Minor manga spoilers for this next paragraph.  The reason I'm not doing the worst handled character in the series? Everyone in this subreddit and their mother knows who it is. It's Katsuki Bakugo. It's not even an opinion anymore, it's a fact. That's why his fakeout deaths and anything bad happening to him (which is virtually nothing) is not only memed to no end but celebrated. Since it's basically a dead horse at this point, I'd rather focus on the next in line.  Contrary to popular opinion, it's not Shigaraki, All For One or Dabi. It's not any of the villains, and it's not any of the students. It's fucking Shota Aizawa, the world's most incompetent teacher.  First, let's go to our introduction of Aizawa. He enters UA's classroom on the floor, sitting in a sleeping bag. Ok. Small red flag, but nothing alarming. Then instead of sending his students to orientation, he sends them to take a quirk assessment test.  Our first red flag. First off, this is completely unnecessary. There is no reason they can't just take the assessment test after orientation other than the fact he thinks it's pointless for virtually no reason. In a span of minutes, he's prevented these kids from knowing anything about the school's resources, faculty, layout and immediately ostracized them from their peers. For no reason other than he doesn't care about it.  Next is the actual quirk assessment tests. Presumably, he grades everyone's scores. I'll go through the actual tests first:  50-Meter Dash  Grip Strength  Standing Long Jump  Repeated Side Steps  Ball Throw  Sit Ups  Seated Toe-Touch  Distance Run  I'll admit this is more of a complaint about the actual tests than Aizawa, but there's still criticism of him here. Some of these students' quirks literally don't help them with the tests. Unless Kaminari's electricity fucking up the grip strength thing counts, his quirk is useless. Hagakure's invisibility is completely useless, and honestly might count against her for the Seated Toe-Touch. Unless Koda's anivoice allow him to have animals take some of these tests for him, he's useless. Jirou's earphone jacks don't have any sort of usability in these tests either. That's four students whose quirks do nothing for these tests. And yet somehow, Midoriya, the kid who was trained by All Might for ten months, can lift five hundred plus pounds, and had presumably the third highest score on the ball throw, got last place?  Forget that. This entire test makes no sense. It literally ostracizes at least four students' and their quirks, relying on physical ability alone. That defeats the entire point of calling it a ""quirk assessment test."" For a supposedly rational teacher, this seems like a pretty weak exam to give your students.  Also, the singling out Midoriya thing. His entire issue with him is how self-destructive his power is to his own body. Motherfucker, go look at Kaminari, the kid that goes fucking braindead if he uses his quirk. Midoriya at least has multiple limbs and fingers to break. Kaminari's quirk is quite literally a one-time use deal, and that can only change in certain situations and with certain support items he didn't have at the time.  Right after, the ball throw, after Midoriya shuts him the fuck up, Bakugo tries to attack him, but Aizawa holds him back. You know what the supposed most rational teacher that expelled and entire class for a complete nonexistent issue does in response? Fuck all. Basically tells the kid ""go back in line."" That's literally it.  After the battle trials, he reviews the footage. His advice to Bakugo after watching the footage of him trying to kill Midoriya and ignore a direct order from All Might? ""Don't feel bad, you did good."" His advice to Midoriya? ""You suck, get better now."" It comes off as especially ridiculous considering that right before, Yaoyorozu literally explains how he did the actual worse out of the group by completely ignoring the battle trial and being the ultimate reason he and his partner failed.  After this, we get him calling All Might the height of irresponsibility. Dude, just shut up. Honestly.  Skip ahead to the Sports Festival where we once again get Aizawa acting as nothing more than Bakugo's mouthpiece. In his battle against Uraraka, he is blatantly not taking the fight seriously, but when the spectators get mad at him over it, saying the fight is unnecessary and to just beat her quickly, he comes to his rescue to say he actually is taking the fight seriously, that he does respect her, that he is taking Uraraka seriously.  Cue to five seconds later, when he effortlessly blows away her plan, but he literally goes to Midoriya and accuses him of telling her to do that completely ineffective plan, immediately shitting all over Aizawa's posturing. Great job, you really know your students.  Also want to mention he literally says that 1A got stronger through their own efforts that he was completely uninvolved with, regarding the USJ incident. This is meant to be a gag for Present Mic to say ""Eraserhead is a shitty teacher!"" but it's completely true because that's exactly what happened.  Hero names comes up. He does nothing, passes the job off to Midnight because he's useless at that thing even though, you know, it's his fucking job to be able to teach that shit. But okay. Skip to the midterm exams where the students have to fight the teachers. Here, Aizawa states he's the one pairing up the students against the teachers (and the principal).  We get Kirishima and Sato vs. Cementoss. In the concrete jungle battlefield. And yet they're expected to beat the man who can control cement in a cement environment. Seriously? We get Kaminari and Mina, stated to be the two dumbest students in the class, against the literal super genius Nezu. Bro. What are you expecting to fucking happen. We get Mineta and Sero vs. Midnight. Motherfucker, she literally puts people to sleep. And you paired her with two students that can't do anything against that. And when the student that prevents the other student from being knocked out gets knocked out, you fail him. Honestly, it's pretty in character for him to do some shit like that at this point. But then there's Uraraka and Aoyama vs. Thirteen.  What. The. Fuck.  Her quirk is to literally suck in and disintegrate things. Her quirk is LITERALLY CALLED BLACK HOLE. And not only do you want them to fucking fight that, but you also say they barely passed because it almost fucking happens? Holy shit this was actually so ridiculous. Now, let's move onto Midoriya and Bakugo vs. All Might.  Every single matchup at this point was completely in the teacher's favor, but this one has it the absolute worse. First, I want to point out the main point of this arc. It was for Aizawa to get his students to become cooperative. Most of these students are already cooperative. His fight had actually the second least cooperation since Todoroki pretty much ignored her abilities and she agreed with him on it, putting the entire plan in his completely untalented hands. But at least they began to work together.  Now, come to All Might vs Midoriya & Bakugo. He paired them up due to their lack of cooperation, completely ignoring one very important fact; this uncooperativeness is completely one-sided. He knows Bakugo has a grudge against Midoriya and will intentionally not work with him, and then the story frames it as if Midoriya has to learn how to cooperate with Bakugo. Fucking no. The entire fight is Bakugo acting like a complete fucking moron because he wants a head-to-head fight against All Might, and when Midoriya, who's not stupid enough to think they can beat the greatest superhero in the world, wants to instead run away (which was already stated to be a completely valid option), Bakugo not only dismisses everything he says, he outright attacks him. And of course, in true fashion of Aizawa's failure as a teacher, this is something that is never brought up again. Coincidentally, because Bakugo's too stupid to realize he's outmatched in every way possible, he gets knocked the fuck out and has to be dragged out by Midoriya to the exit to win the exam. Bakugo still passes. This isn't a problem on its own, but then you have to take a look at Sero failing the exam despite being dragged out.  He literally failed for the exact same reasons, but gives Bakugo a pass.  He wants these students to learn how shitty and harsh the real world is. To him, the exam is supposed to be reflective of how they'll do in actual combat. Meaning if they get knocked out or stalemated, they don't just fail, they're either dead or getting innocent people killed. By this logic, Bakugo's failure had just gotten him killed. But not in Aizawa's eyes. Nope, Bakugo gets a pass, because why the fuck wouldn't Aizawa, probably his second or third biggest dickrider completely ignore it?  It's just way too much shit at this point for anyone to consider this dude a good teacher. He has not taught a single lesson at this point, resorting to either falling asleep in class, giving fundamentally flawed exams, or passing off the duty to other teachers. He literally says to All Might ""make sure they learn something from this"" after telling the other teachers he's going to be the one choosing who fights who. Motherfucker, it is your job to teach something from the tests. Not pass it off to the completely inexperienced teacher, who at this point has already taught so much more than you.  Now we get to the Forest Training arc. He's giving supplementary courses along with Vlad King for the students that failed the exam. And in 1B's class, Monoma's the only one that failed. This means that at this point in the story, Vlad King has already trained his students to much more efficiency than Aizawa has to the point that after taking the exact same test against the exact same teachers, more of Vlad King's students beat more of the teachers. And somehow I'm supposed to be annoyed by Monoma's opinion that 1A as a whole is incompetent? Yeah, it kinda seems like it because Aizawa hasn't taught anyone a single fucking thing.  Not to mention that Aizawa, once again, passes the responsibility of teaching onto the Pussycats. This is also the last time the students ever train. This guy needs to be fired.  Skip the Forest arc. Get to the Hideout Raid arc. It's revealed that Bakugo was kidnapped because the League of Villains think he could make a great villain. They don't only target him because of the fact that converting a hero into a villain would completely shatter the opinion of the HPSC and society as a whole, but because of Bakugo's overall person. He's narcissistic, he's an asshole, he's antagonistic, he's downright psychotic. He's not corrected on any of this behavior by Aizawa (or literally any teacher ever) and it leads to the villains to the (right) assumption he'd be a good villain. His response that Bakugo might become a villain after being captured?  ""Nah, I know him. He wants to win too badly to become a villain.""  I'm paraphrasing clearly, but that's just about the gist of it. He doesn't say anything about Bakugo being heroic at his core, but that he wants to win, and joining the villains is the opposite of that. And his continuous lunatic behavior is completely ignored until the end of time.  When everyone gets out, he says he would've expelled everyone but Jiro, Hagakure and Bakugo if it weren't for being blocked by his higher ups. The five that rescued Bakugo, because how dare they do something so completely necessary that the experienced heroes were completely unable to do? Not only that, he says he would've expelled everyone else for not stopping them. My guy, shut the fuck up. For once, please shut the fuck up about how bad your students are and fucking TEACH THEM SOMETHING!  Now skip until the Midoriya vs. Bakugo fight. Aizawa is literally informed that Bakugo initiated the fight, and his punishment is for them is house arrest. It literally doesn't serve to do anything but miss useful class time that will help them become pro heroes, and instead ostracizes them further from their 1A classmates. My guy, do literally anything. I don't even know why you're punishing Midoriya after being told Bakugo started the fucking fight. Go put that little psycho in anger management classes or therapy sessions with Hound Dog or something. Fuck.  Skip ahead to the Culture Festival. He's just sleeping around in class all day while the students plan the festival. Not even scenes of him giving lessons, just sleeping. Skip to the Joint Training arc, regarded as the worst arc of the series because of how unimportant it is compared to everything else.  This is where we learn that Shinso, the kid from the Sports Festival that did nothing but whine about how hard it was being able to mind control people, was getting training from Aizawa.  You have got to be fucking kidding me.  This dude has not once given a lesson throughout the entire season. Not once, not a single goddamn time, not to a single goddamn student. But he gives it to Shinso because he couldn't beat some robots?  There is quite literally no excuse. He can't say that he felt bad for him for having a quirk that doesn't work against robots. Not when Hagakure and Mineta exist, two students that can't destroy the robots with their quirks. Especially not when Midoriya exists, cause in the fucking Sports Festival he literally cleaved one with it's own broken body part. And no, there is no ""off switch."" That's a completely fabricated fanmade theory as to why they passed. And only hurts Shinso more because if that was the case, he can literally just turn them off.  Last point; he only has a problem with Midoriya. I already said it, but it needs to be stated again. He literally nicknames him ""problem child"" despite the existence of Bakugo and Mineta. He then proceeds to not try to correct his ""problematic"" behavior. Just shut the fuck up, dude.  Now to recap. Aizawa doesn't teach his students anything, ostracizes them from their peers, prevents them from knowing how to properly use UA's facilities, singles out a student for no other reason than his quirk is too strong for his body (something he can and does actively train), passes on the teaching responsibility to literally everyone else, and literally seeks out a student that has no business being in the hero course to train him despite the other twenty kids he completely ignores.  Sorry Aizawa fans. Your favorite homeless-looking teacher is absolutely awful at his job and should be fired."
"Given the several discussions here discussing terrible anime characters, I figured I'd share one of the worse offenders, who is next level Mineta and is the actual hero.  Meliodas from Seven Deadly Sins routinely sexually assaults his ""love"" interest, along with other female characters he encounters. By this I mean he will literally grab their breasts, repeatedly, at least once when said ""love"" interest was actually asleep, look up her skirt and ruffle it up so that everyone can see her panties.  This kind of behavior is constant. I don't think there's a single episode in which he does not do this, at least when there's not too much fighting to keep him from indulging in what is frankly, utterly gross.  To have an idea of how bad it gets, here is just a sample:"
"As the name implies this technique is based around summoning 7 different Shikigami with abilities related to the Seven Deadly Sins.  Each shikigami is tiny (1 foot tall) and is unable to attack, the trade off being that they are indestructible and only disappear once the curse energy used to summon them has been exhausted.  In order to use the technique the user must stake a certain amount of cursed energy and make contact with the target. Once this has been done, the desired Shikigami is summoned and attaches itself to the target.  The shikigami will then automatically use its ability and slowly deplete its reserve of cursed energy. As a rough scale, the longest the user would be about to summon a shikigami would be an hour and that would take most of their cursed energy.  The whole process is very similar in concept to Knuckle's Hackoware Hatsu from Hunterxhunter.  The Seven Deadly Sins abilities are below.  Wrath: The target is filled with a sense of unbridled and irrational anger, they will attack recklessly like a wild animal. Expending more cursed energy than necessary on attack and leaving their defences open  Lust: The target is charmed by the user and will treat them as an ally/friend/lover. If the target is already overtly hostile the technique will fail. Definitely a non combat ability.  Pride: The target grows overconfident in their abilities, they use less cursed energy with each attack but believe they are doing more damage. They also use less cursed energy reinforcing their defences thinking the opponents attacks are weak.  Sloth: The target becomes extremely lethargic. With both their mental and physical abilities slowed dramatically.  Gluttony: Gluttony begins draining the targets cursed energy, which in turn replenishes its own reserve. However as a trade off Gluttony burns through its reserve of energy far faster than the other shikigami. If the target limits its use of cursed energy, Gluttony with die fairly quickly.  Greed: This Shikigami works very similarly to Gluttony in that it steals the targets cursed energy, however the stolen energy is transferred to the user instead. As a balance it is stolen at a much slower rate.  Envy: Whilst Envy is attached, the user gains the curse technique of the target. They do not neccassirly gain immediate profiency with it and if their body is unsuitable for the technique it doesn't become so. For instance Limitless would still be useless to the user and they wouldn't be able to change their own body like Mahito.  The challenge with this technique is managing the users cursed energy reserves. If they try to apply too many long lasting Shikigami to a target, they will have no reserves to bolster their own body for combat"
"With the return of the anime and seeing how popular the novel is in this community, I decided to pick it up. Lightly irritated by the first-person perspective, I pushed on. 50 pages in and I can't shrug off the feeling that r/thatHappened holds more believable stories than this. Throughout the bus scene, every brain cell responsible for my social awareness screamed, cringed, and begged me to stop reading. No-just no. Not here, most certainly not in Japan. A scene like that wouldn't have ever played out.  Anyway, I sighed and continued turning the pages. I remember liking the MC back when the first season of the anime aired. I held onto that, trying to ignore the mediocre prose. Then the introduction scene happened. What happened, was he always so lame?  I strictly remember him being some kind of a genius who always had things his way. Sure, he wasn't the most charismatic, I think, but this was... bad. Pathetic even.  Oh God, I'd have lots of inner monologues like those ahead, wouldn't I?  So utterly disappointed by all of the aspects of the novel... Well, there was one redeeming factor. The one ecchi illustration inside was kinda decent, although the art style is so generic that AI would spit out something more interesting. I just shrugged, I'm good. Back to reading other stuff.  So yeah. I don't really intend on giving it another go. Mostly wanted to see how unpopular my opinion was."
"I have read up till year 2 volume 7 of Classroom of the Elite, and have watched both seasons of the anime, and I think that Ayanokoji is a garbage main character and his overpowered intelligence, abilities, and qualities make COTE boring and unwatchable/unreadable. I know most people will disagree with me but I want to get this off my chest. So here are five reasons why Ayanokoji sucks and ruins COTE. Spoilers for LN & Anime.   Ayanokoji's Abilities: Ayanokoji has been shown to have been perfect in every aspect, including physical ability and intelligence. Now, this is not always a bad thing as some of my favorite characters such as Lelouch from Code Geass also are prodigal geniuses with god-given abilities, but ayanokoji has no flaws. This means there is essentially no conflict and plot in COTE, as it is a given that everyone is inferior to him and that everything will go according to his plan every time. Meaning interesting villains like Ryuuen and Sakayanagi are subdued with no effort and do not get to create the conflict they deserve. Even other White room students like Amsaawa Ichika and Yamagi are either miles below ayanokoji or always pathetically lose to him with little to no difficulty for ayanokoji. This makes COTE so fucking boring.  Harem and social skills: A good possible angle that Ayano's character could have been taken is the fact that he has no previous exposure to the outside world, being an artificially created superhuman in a training facility, and how he may have dealt with interpersonal relationships would have been very cool to look at. Maybe how he may have dealt with and overcome his sociopathy and tried to empathize with others or how he began to learn how to socialise properly, and possibly form romantic relationships with others. But instead ayanokoji of course has to be a master at social skills and manipulating others from the get-go, building a fucking harem of women who are head over heels for him. Some women such as Sakura and Ichinose, even fell in love with him because ""he was nice"" 💀💀. Such an interesting concept is gone to waste to make ayanokoji the most dick rided character in all of fiction. He of course has to be described as extremely good looking and having a thirteen inch cock (Not even kidding, because ofcourse he has to), to make him lacking of any flaws, and so perfect that their is zero interest in his social life either. He gives social and leadership advice to everyone in the novel like a sage of a thousand years of knowledge, despite never actually having lived a normal life and living with other normal human beings, and he is of course always right.  Snore-invoking personality: Both the anime AND LN have this problem. Now I know a lot of people agree that Ayano in the Anime is boring as fuck, but even in the LN this man is just as boring in my opinion and his intentions and ideologies contradict each other throughout the story. He says he wants to live a normal high school life, yet despite having all the ability to do so, continues to get involved in everything and create problems for himself, knowingly and now suddenly his goal changed to wanting to get to class A, and it is unexplained why. Furthermore, he wants to see the development of Horikita and Kei, and other characters in the novel, yet claim that all humans are tools and he does not care about anyone. It's like an edgy fucking self-insert was written just so his terrible fanbase can dickride him. He also has no hobbies or interests, or real fears, desires, and dreams, even after gaining the freedom to do so, making it impossible to see him as a human being. The only interesting thing about his personality is that he has psychopathic tendencies yet instead of seeing it as a flaw or as something he needs to change, the fanbase loves their edgy little psychopath.  His feats of intelligence are boring after the first five novels: This is a bit harder to explain. Ayanokojis feats of intelligence were very carefully planned and thought out by the author and had readers follow along and understand why the feat was so clever as well as not be so simplistic that it downplays Ayano. It is quite possibly the only reason I have been reading COTE. I love it when characters must think out and plan behind the scenes, while also giving the tools for the readers to try to solve the challenge along with the MC. And when the MC gives the solution, it comes off as clever and something that has the reader at the edge of their seat. Characters like Yuiichi from Tomodachi game, Nana from Talentless Nana or Akiyama from Liar game, all are great examples of how to present feats of intelligence, so that readers can stay interested and marvel at the clever yet ingenuine tactics they use, even when are given the same information we are. The Author of COTE stopped justifying Ayanakoki's feats of intelligence and putting depth into his tactics, with his feats of intelligence now being that he somehow knew the exact plan of his opponent or that he somehow defeated Sakayanagi in chess (Hated that as a chess fan that no real details were given about the game) or that he is simply smart enough to get 100% on any test he wants. Now that interest that once came with COTE, is no longer there. Ayanakoji just boringly subdues his opponents either through physical strength or an unexplained strategy that somehow causes everyone to lose except for him.  Dick riding fanbase: And finally his d-riding fanbase. There has been this fascination with characters who can ""manipulate"" and characters who are ""sigma"" and ""psychos"". Examples include Patrick Bateman, Homelander, Johan Liebert, etc. This fascination has of course translated to anime fanbases and Ayanokoji has not been spared. Everybody wants to be just like ayanokoji and not just ironically as people will lead you to believe. I am getting videos on my youtube recommended about some motherfucking '48 laws of power, how to be like ayanokoji'. Or fucking 'what to read to be like ayanokoji'. They treat his desire not to standout and his lack of empathy for others as a self insert characteristic, mistaking him to relatable in an edgy sort of way an rather mentally ill super soldier. Any scene where he looks at women and is describing their features in the LN to better paint a picture for readers is having him be mistaken for being a horny teenager and therefore super relatable. Honestly such a stupid fanbase and it's difficult to tell when people are unironically dick-riding him or not. Yes, ayanokoji's a 200 IQ artificially made genius. But that doesn't mean his intelligence is written well. His writing is a million times below characters like Johan, Light, Dazai, Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes, and despite how intelligent he is said to be, his feats and his writing will never live up to any of the characters I mentioned.   Ayanokoji's boring and stoic writing with no flaws, development, plot or conflict, has not only harmed the story and his character but other characters. Ichinose's interesting ideology on group effort and her leadership were great, but her character has been reduced to being obsessed over the super sexy genius Ayanokoji. Ryuuen's interesting malicious yet intelligent tactics and dictatorship over his class, gave a great villain who could possibly rival ayanokoji, but of course, he was beaten up so hard he became a sidelined fucking tsundere in the story. The supergenius Sakayanagi had finally won a chess game against ayanokoji, yet the author to save ayano, had to throw in the bs reason that his moves weren't being made as he commanded and that he would have destroyed her if they played fairly. Even opponents who came from his past like Yamagi and Ichika that were trained the same way he was, which would serve as a great conflict, are explained to be a thousand times worse than ayano and are easily destroyed or worship him. I FUCKING HATE THIS UGLY-ASS MIDDLE-PARTED EBOY ASS HAIR CUT YELLOW-EYED BRUNETTE. Such a cool fucking concept like a school with fucking puzzles and challenges to compete with others is ruined because we needed an MC so powerful that everyone in the story has to suck his left testicle. I recommend anybody who decided to read this rant and has not watched COTE or it not caught up to never watch or read this shit."
"I'm not trying to ask you guys to do my homework for me or anything, but, how did you guys learn math so well?  A little bit of back story, I've been bad with most mathematics my entire life. I'm a college student now who has been getting decent grades, (B's A's I'll admit a few C's here and there) except for math. I've failed elementary algebra... twice... I'm very ashamed to say this, but it's true. Every time I see an equation I just blank out and have no idea how to conceive the numbers and how to deduce them into an answer.  Algebra is literally the only thing keeping me from graduating, but you guys seem to get it!  Guys I just want to say that all of your responses are great and helpful. Also, I had no idea there was a subreddit called r/learnmath otherwise I would have posted there obviously lol.  How can I improve my skills with numbers? How do you guys do it?"
"When I was in the 6th grade, I discovered how to masturbate and it probably was the best thing I ever did at that time. But when I discovered masturbation and the feeling of cumming, it's like my hornyness skyrocketed.  I had the biggest crush on my teacher and the clothes she wore made it even worst for my young hormones. The first time I masturbated at school is when she came over and squatted down to help the student next to me, causing her shirt to rise up, showing her panties and they were thong and at that moment I lost it and asked to go to the bathroom and masturbated while thinking about her.  It got to the point where I would bring a little thing of Vaseline to school with me and would masturbate almost everyday at school. Thinking about her or the The librarian.  It’s crazy because my crush on the librarian started after I just finished masturbating to the thought of my teacher. After I finished masturbating to my teach, I walked around the corner to wash my hands and the librarian was at the sink washing out her coffee pot and just knowing she was in there while I was masturbating did something to me."
"Wasn’t really bullied in high school other than this one Jock, We were originally friends but as soon as I stated getting a little more feminine as a guy he became relentless it wasn’t like openly bullying but name calling every time I walked past him, always making fun, faggot, pussy, queer were daily but met up with a friend from high school recently who’s a real power top and he mentioned my bullies name which I didn’t expect, but what he told/showed me next was crazy the former jock (won’t name them), prom king, mr perfect is now a cross dressing bottom who absolutely adores my friends cock just found it kind of funny the thing he used to bully me over he’s become but more! Funny how life works."
"I would like to share my feelings on private school vs public school. I feel free to join the discussion if you are so inclined. I am a bit heated right now, so apologies if I ramble on.  I decided to post this because I keep seeing, across all forms of media, the implication that private school is “good” and public school is “bad”. This mindset has spread through movies, TV shows, and has ingrained itself into the mind of our culture. This makes me angry on so many levels! Public school is a fundamental part of what makes our country amazing. It allows access to education for everyone. Private schools have perverted that system and public schools now have a bad reputation. Here are some of my beliefs, in no particular order.  Private schools often don’t require a credential for teachers to teach there. People seem to think that you get better teachers at private school, but often they are not trained in education and haven’t had experience working with kids prior.  Private schools get to pick and choose which students they accept. Any student who doesn’t perform as well or who has even the slightest behavioral needs or learning accommodations can be kicked out. This is now private schools can boost their test scores and seem like they are so much better. They only take the kids who fit their mold. In a private-only model, so many students would be left in the dust and denied an education.  Private schools are essentially a way to resegregate schools. Families of wealth, often white families with generational wealth, pay tens of thousands of dollars to not have to go to school with “those kids”. The private schools then use that money to buy state of the art equipment and technology for those already privileged students, causing the education gap to widen. If all of that money was diverted to making public education stronger, then EVERYONE would have access to these materials.  This is more on the backend, but private schools aren’t unionized in most cases. Teachers have no protections and often make less money. The schools can do whatever they want at any time. I love having the support of a union for collective bargaining and to protect teachers from unjust firings.  Overall, I believe that private schools are a cancerous leech on our education system. I don’t remember where I heard this quote, but it was something along the lines of “if you force the rich kids to go to public school, the quality of the public schools will improve dramatically”. We as a nation need to start investing in our public schools and start cracking down on private school who are sucking up resources that could be used to benefit everyone.  I have more, but I can’t think of them right now. I’m happy to respectfully debate with anyone who disagrees with me on this topic."

"People are always saying how they don’t enjoy or never enjoyed school, and think that it’s perfectly normal. I’m not saying that our current school system shouldn’t be hated. I’m saying it’s messed up that people think it’s normal to hate school, when it actually shows how much the system sucks. You shouldn’t have to dread going to school, but that’s how things have been, since our school system is terrible. My point is, we shouldn’t normalize school being hated, for being educated as a child is important. We should change the system so that it’s NOT commonly hated by children, so that hating school isn’t normal."
I absolutely hated school up until 9th grade for two reasons.  First is that I didn’t have a choice. I had to go. When I could at least in theory drop out whenever I wanted. (I say in theory because my parents would have killed me) Once I was making the conscious decision to be there I stopped resenting it.  Second is that I was severely bullied in middle school. Luckily for me most of the bullies decided to drop out when they got to high school so my high schools atrocious drop out rate actually worked in my favor.
"The concept of “the grind” (specifically in America) has desensitized us to the dysfunction of the environments that we spend the majority of our lives in. I’m not saying that things should or can be perfect - that is simply unrealistic. It just frustrates me how many people will respond to an address of this issue with “that’s just how life is, we can’t change it.” The truth is, NOTHING will EVER change if there most people blindly accept the conditions as they are. It does not in fact need to be this way.  Personally, I love learning. However, as someone with high intelligence and severe ADHD, the school system does not accommodate me as a student without extensive adjustment. It is the structure of the school SYSTEM, not the pursuit of knowledge, that causes the majority of students’ issues with school. Education is a very special thing, and we can absolutely be critical of our learning environment in order to subsequently ACT to fix these issues."
