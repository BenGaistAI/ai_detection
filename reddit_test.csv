"I do small web builds for local businesses, mostly boring stuff where I quietly add quality-of-life improvements so people don’t accidentally hurt themselves using their own site. New client, mid sized company, big ego. They sent a very detailed spec (like, “button should be 110px wide” detailed) and in the kickoff call their project lead said the magic words: “Just build it exactly like the document. Don’t improvise. Don’t add anything. We’ve had vendors get creative and we hated it.” I tried to clarify: do you want basic validations, helpful defaults, little things like confirming before deleting? He cut me off. “If it’s not in the spec, it doesn’t exist. Print it out if you need to.” The next day a courier shows up with a literal printed spec, 26 pages, and the last page has a signature block with his name and date. I took a photo of that page because I could feel the future argument forming.  Normally, for a form heavy app, I add small things: auto-formatting phone numbers, sensible error messages, a “remember my last choice” toggle, keyboard shortcuts, a slightly nicer layout on mobile, that kind of stuff. None of that was in their spec. Their spec was basically: fields, submit button, confirmation page, done. It even said “Error message: ‘Invalid input’.” Not “Invalid email format”, just “Invalid input.” So I built it like a robot. Every field accepted raw text until submit. If anything was wrong, one generic red banner at the top: “Invalid input.” No field highlighting. No inline hints. No autocorrect. No autofill. Their spec showed the confirm button at the bottom of a long page, so on mobile it required a lot of scrolling. I followed their pixel sizes too, which meant some labels got cut off on smaller screens. I didn’t fix it because the spec didn’t mention responsive behavior. I kept a checklist and literally ticked each line item off. It felt petty, but it was also exactly what they demanded.  Demo day on Zoom. I share my screen, walk through the build. Five minutes in, the project lead frowns and goes, “Why is this so inconvenient?” I said, calmly, “Because that’s how it is in the spec you signed. You told me not to add anything that wasn’t written.” He tried to pivot: “Well obviously we assumed basic usability.” I pulled up the scanned signature page and the line where he wrote “no improvements, follow spec exactly” in an email. I didn’t say it smugly, I just let the silence do its thing. Their designer on the call actually laughed, like a tiny cough laugh, and said, “So you… did what we asked.” The lead got red and started listing fixes he suddenly wanted: inline errors, mobile layout, confirmations, better messages. I agreed and said I can do a change order, new timeline, and they can update the spec so we’re all on the same page. After the call, they left a review on my profile that basically said “good but too rigid” and then emailed me the next morning asking if I was available for Phase 2 because “your attention to detail is unmatched.” Sure, as long as the next spec includes the spirit part too."
" I'm a designer, I do web stuff. Bold of that designer to laugh in any way if they're the ones who either did or guided this work. Having a spec doc that detailed but not considering very basic things like changing states when you click into a form field is... really bad. Not including any nods to responsive is really bad, too. It's disrespectful to your developer and makes me wonder if they're actually a web designer or just a designer asked to make a web application. The difference matters a lot.  Bad form to set a developer up to make design decisions like state styling when you know your boss is going to be a pain in the ass about it. All you're doing is setting them up to do more work they shouldn't have to and, in this case, get yelled at. Which is some bullshit."
"Anyway, I was in the middle of an intense interview process with a few software companies and had reached the final stage with two of them. About two weeks ago, the recruiter from one of them called me and presented their supposedly 'competitive' offer. I tried to negotiate the numbers a bit, but they were firm. Honestly, I was hesitant. Part of me was thinking 'a bird in the hand...' and I was worried about losing the other opportunities, so I told them to send the paperwork over.  Anyway, three days later, the second company got back to me. Their offer came with a 50% higher salary, a signing bonus, and a few extra vacation days. It was a no-brainer, of course. As soon as I received the written offer, I sent a professional email to the first company, letting them know I wouldn't be moving forward because the compensation wasn't a good fit.  The next morning, their recruiter left me a voicemail. She sounded genuinely shocked and asked for more details about my reason for declining. I'm not going to lie, it was a great feeling of validation. And I'm very happy with how things turned out in the end."
"Lopez v. Apple centered on claims that Siri frequently recorded users without their knowledge or consent. Whistleblowers revealed that the assistant would ""false trigger"" on everyday sounds, like a zipper or the word ""seriously,"" and recorded highly sensitive audio. The snippets were sent to human contractors who ""graded"" the clips, often hearing private medical consultations, business deals, and intimate moments.  Despite Apple’s privacy branding, real people were reviewing up to 1,000 recordings per shift to check for accuracy. Contractors reported that the simple mechanical sound of a zipper was frequently misinterpreted by Apple Watches as a ""Siri"" wake command, leading to accidental recordings of people getting dressed or using the restroom. Also, while Apple denied using Siri for ads, the lawsuit highlighted ""uncanny coincidences"" where users saw ads for Air Jordans or Olive Garden immediately after discussing them in private rooms with Siri enabled devices."
"The first few moments after we wake up may be the most influential time of our day.  For years, these moments may have belonged to nicotine a learned routine so automatic it felt like part of waking up itself.  Take a look: telling yourself to “just stop” rarely works when your brain and hands are wired to a familiar morning rhythm. But meaningful change doesn’t require a total life overhaul.  Sometimes, it starts with a 60-second pivot. Small Shift, Small Win, Real Impact.  Behavioral research consistently shows that the first action after waking strongly predicts how firmly a habit stays embedded. When you intentionally replace that high-risk “trigger slot” with a different physical routine, you interrupt the trigger-response loop before it fully activates. This isn’t about willpower. It’s about sequence.  DermaBreak is designed to function as a one-minute morning anchor — a simple, intentional ritual that replaces an automatic routine with a grounded one, while supporting skin comfort and appearance.  Redirect the Habit: Replace the automatic hand-to-mouth routine with a calming, tactile skincare application.  Own the First Morning Moments: Changing the most influential moment of the morning helps reset the tone for the rest of the day. Consistency That Sticks: Stable replacement routines are easier to maintain than resistance alone.  Plan for Triggers: Lasting change comes from identifying high-risk moments and preparing a better response in advance.  One minute. One new ritual. A better way to start the day.

"I (36M) have been with my wife (33F) for about ten years married for seven. She deals with a chronic pain condition that flares up pretty bad sometimes. A few years ago when I got promoted and we were in a better spot financially I told her to leave her job and focus on herself. She didnt want to at first because she felt guilty but honestly it was the best decision we ever made. Her health has improved so much since then.  I like taking care of her. I like doing nice things for her.  On her good days she handles most of the house stuff and on bad days I pick up whatever needs doing. We have a system that works for us. I also just enjoy treating her. I bring her flowers, I cook for her, I take her out, I encourage her hobbies. Its not some transaction its just how I love her.  My aunt (52F) my moms younger sister cannot stand this. She has been married to my uncle for like 25 years and from what everyone can see hes not exactly husband of the year. He never takes her anywhere, doesnt help around the house, is weird about money even though they both work. My aunt complains about him constantly to my mom but then turns around and takes it out on my wife.  Every family gathering its the same thing. If I mention my wife started a pottery class my aunt says ""must be nice to have nothing to do all day."" If I mention I cooked dinner because my wife wasnt feeling great she says ""so youre doing everything now."" If my mom brings up a gift I got my wife my aunt makes some comment about how my wife has me ""wrapped around her finger.""  Its been years of this. I usually just ignore it or change the subject because I know its coming from a place of jealousy and I feel bad for her honestly. Her marriage sounds miserable.  But last sunday we were at my parents for dinner. My wife wasnt there she was home resting because she had a rough week. I mentioned I needed to leave a little early because I wanted to pick up her prescription on the way home and make sure she ate something. My aunt literally laughed and said ""that girl has you trained like a dog. Shes the most spoiled woman Ive ever seen.""  I looked at her and said ""shes not spoiled. Your husband just doesnt give a shit about you and youre taking it out on my wife because you cant deal with that.""  after years of her taking shots at my wife who has never done anything to her I just couldnt take another one. my wife shouldnt have to be the punching bag for my aunts unhappy marriage AITJ?"
"Let me start off by saying that this is not an Illuga hate post. Infact i love him very much.  With that out of the way, there is something that i need to rant about.  For a little bit of context: I only pull characters i like, meta be fucking dammed. I pulled flins, not because he was a shiny new dps but because i liked his character. I pulled for c1 neuvillette when this patch dropped aswell.  Here's the problem. I've seen the memes going around that no one can get their hands on illuga... Well im here to say that I'm confident i took them all. As of now i have a c5 Illuga, whos sitting at level one.  You might be thinking 'But why level one? When you started this post you mentioned that you love Illuga.' Correct... but he is literally fucking useless to me. WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.  Look i will use whoever the fuck i like on a team, half the time they dont even synergise well. If hoyo hadn't been so greedy as to not allow illuga to cause lunar crystallise, then i would be using him alongside Neuvillette. I genuinely do not care.  But i can't even do that.  I love Illuga so fucking much and he is fundamentally useless. I have him c fucking 5, and i cannot make use of any of it.  I was fine with aino not triggering lunar reactions because she was given for free, and was always meant to be a worse columbina. I coped with Jahoda because she was anemo and therefore shouldn't trigger lunar reactions.  But Illuga is where i draw the fucking line. Why did hoyo feel the need to make a whole thing about nod krai having moon wheels and therefore different elemental reactions only to lock it behind the fucking 5 stars.  Natlan 4 stars can trigger/interact with nightsoul. Fontaine 4 stars have the Pneuma/Ousia thing and hp mechanics.  Like it was just a greed thing, and i am so fucking pissed that i cannot use Illuga anywhere because of said greed.  I do not want to pull for characters i do not want just to be able to use my favourites.  I needed to get this off my chest because holy fuck i cannot belive the level of greed they pulled so that the fucking 4 stars of a region cannot even take part in a mechanic."
" I mean... I'm not that surprised. We got two Nod-Krai 4* characters before Iluga: Aino and Jahoda. First one wasn't a huge surprise when it comes to not being able to do Lunar Reactions. She is hydro, nobody expected a free 4* to unlock EVERY variant of new reactions. Jahoda is anemo, so she doesn't have her element's equivalent of LR. Could she do LR with swirled elements? Maybe, but it would also be weird that one 4* gets most of LR possible. Illuga is our first Nod-Krai 4* that has element creating it's own LR. If any character was supposed to be a confirmation of LR capabilities on 4*, it was him. I'm not trying to defend Hoyo. I really think he should be able to do LR. And yes, I agree fully that it's not a good sign. So let's hope it's not because of Hoyo wanting to lock new mechanics from 4* characters."
"My nephew (9m), Josh, invited my son (14m) Liam, to sleep over at his house. Liam spoke to me about it and said he really didn’t want to, his kid cousin kind of annoys him and he didn’t feel comfortable doing a sleepover with someone 5 years younger. I said no problem, just tell Josh no thank you, and I thought that was the end of it.  That weekend we had a family get together and Liam asked if he could skip it and go to his friend’s house instead, and I said yes.  We arrived at my sisters house and she asked where Liam was, and I said he’s gone to his friend. She started screaming at me, calling me selfish, saying I’m so entitled and how dare I think I can treat her son this way, that I’m teaching my kids to disrespect her kids.  I was totally blindsided, I had no idea what she was on about.  Then it came out that Josh was so excited about the sleepover, they’d set up a movie screen with mattresses in the loft, they’d bought special treats, and that he’d been telling everyone all week he was having a sleepover with his big cousin.  I started apologising and said I had no idea, Liam and I discussed how he wasn’t comfortable with it, and I thought he’d let Josh know it wasn’t happening.  Then my sister says, oh he did say he doesn’t want to, but I told him he has to, that sometimes we have to make sacrifices for family, so no was not an acceptable answer and that the sleepover is happening.  I said wait a second, that’s not ok. My kids know that they can set boundaries that feel right for them, they don’t have to do things they’re not comfortable with just to save other people feeling disappointed.  She then starts going off at me, screaming in my face that I can f-off with my f-ing boundaries, that nobody gets to disappoint her kids, that I’m evil and shallow and don’t deserve to be in her life and she’d never forgive me for this.  I burst into tears, took my other kids and left. Went to pick up Liam and asked him to show me the messages between him and Josh. Josh doesn’t have his own phone so they’d messaged on my sisters phone. Reading through the messages I could see that Liam had politely declined the sleepover invite 5 TIMES!! But my sister kept telling him he can’t say no and the sleepover is happening. He said he didn’t know how to handle it and that’s why he asked to go to his friend instead.  Now I have got myself all confused and in a state because my sisters gone to the whole family who are all angry with me, telling me that I should have made Liam do the sleepover, and that it’s true that we make sacrifices for family. My brother even said that I’m teaching Liam to be selfish and entitled.  Some friends agree with me, but others said poor Josh, he’s only little, you should have made Liam do the sleepover, he’d get over it quicker than Josh would get over that kind of rejection.  So I don’t know what side is up anymore. AITA for letting Liam make that call, or am I teaching him to be selfish and entitled?"
" NTA. I'd post the screenshots of the texts to a family group chat and make it clear I'd be going LC/NC with anyone who defends your sister's DISGUSTING behavior. ""Nobody can disappoint my kid, so you should disappoint yourself by forcing them to go!"" ""If he doesnt do what I want him to do hes entitled!"" Like, what flippy-floppy reality do these people live in? Certainly not yours or mine. Personally, I wouldnt want me or my children around entitled toxic abusers. And yes, I consider trampling a child's boundaries and trying to coerce and manipulate them to be abusive. Your sister, imo, was emotionally abusing your son.  If youre worried about losing a support system if you go LC, I mean... they don't seem very supportive to me as it is. Maybe to your golden child of a sister, but not to you and yours."
"So it was my birthday yesterday. I’m (20s) living at home right now with my parents to save money. My sister ""Kayla"" came over for dinner with her 4yo son, Leo.  Quick context: Kayla is EXTREMELY strict about Leo’s diet. Like, no processed sugar, no dyes, basically no ""fun"" food ever. I think it’s a bit much but I usually just stay out of it.  I bought myself a really nice, expensive chocolate cake for my birthday. I didn’t ask anyone else to pay for it, I just wanted a specific one from a local bakery. After dinner, I brought it out.  Kayla immediately got tense. She asked why I couldn't have waited until they left to bring it out. I told her it’s my birthday dinner and I wanted cake? My parents were having fruit, but I sat down and started eating a slice.  Leo obviously saw it and started asking for some. Kayla told him no, it’s ""yucky"" and ""bad for him."" He started crying because, well, he’s 4 and it’s a giant chocolate cake.  Kayla lost it. She called me a brat and said I was ""taunting"" a child and ""disrespecting her parenting"" by eating it in front of him. She ended up grabbing her stuff and leaving early while Leo was still sobbing.  Now my mom is saying I shouldn't have done that and should have just waited an hour to eat my own cake to keep the peace. I feel like I’m going crazy. It’s my house (well, my parents' house, but I live here) and my birthday. Am I actually overreacting by thinking she's being insane?"
" Yeah, this is a trend that I've noticed a lot with millennial and now older-genZ parents -- they get so hellbent on trying to fix what they hated from their childhood that they go to the extreme to eliminate any possible thing they dislike from their kids' lives. They think they are doing the right things, but they don't realize how much they are sheltering their kids and not letting their kids learn how to overcome unfamiliar/uncomfortable scenarios. Kids need to learn these skills in order to become competent adults.  In this specific scenario, the mother is not teaching her kid healthy food habits. She is not teaching her child how to enjoy something in moderation.  There is a very good chance this type of parenting will lead the kid into unhealthy eating habits like extreme binging and no willpower when it comes to foods they were never allowed to be near them."
"I (25M) am an electrician. I did a four year apprenticeship and Ive been working full time in the trade since I was 20. I make good money, I own my truck, Im saving for a house. Im not struggling. I say this because its relevant to why I finally lost my shit.  My girlfriend (24F) has this friend (24F) who is genuinely one of the most insufferable people Ive ever met. She works in marketing or social media or something and her entire vibe is that shes better than everyone who didnt go the college to corporate pipeline route. Every conversation somehow circles back to how important it is to have a ""real career"" and how she could never be with someone who ""works with their hands.""  Shes said stuff like that directly in front of me multiple times. Things like ""no offense but I just need someone on my level intellectually"" while looking at me. Or ""I dont get how people are okay with just being tradesmen their whole life."" My girlfriend usually changes the subject or tells her to chill but it keeps happening.  Ive let it slide for months because my girlfriend cares about her and I didnt want to start drama. But last weekend we were all hanging out and this girl looks at my girlfriend and goes ""honestly babe you could do so much better. You need a guy with actual ambition not someone whos gonna be crawling through walls his whole life."" She said it casually like she was giving genuine advice. Right in front of me. Then did that little smile like she was half joking but we all knew she wasnt.  I looked at her and said ""you have a communications degree that youre still paying off, youve been at the same entry level job for two years, your parents still pay your car insurance and your rent, and youve been single for as long as Ive known you. Maybe figure out your own ambition before you come for mine.""  She went completely silent. Like mouth open no words silent. Then she got up and left. My girlfriend said I went too far and that her friend says those things because shes insecure about her own situation and I shouldnt have gone for everything at once like that.  I told my girlfriend I was fine with the casual jabs for months but telling her to leave me while Im sitting right there is where I draw the line. I said I wont apologize until she apologizes for disrespecting our relationship to my girlfriends face."
"​""Sarah"" (not her real name) and I have been incredibly close friends for over five years. We met in college, and we've been practically inseparable since. We've gone on trips together, we call each other every week, and we share everything. I've always seen her as my absolute best friend my platonic soulmate. ​Here's where I messed up, apparently. I have been single for a while, and recently, I've started casually seeing a few different people. Since Sarah and I share everything, I've been open with her about this. I was treating her as the close confidante she is, asking for advice and occasionally venting about the ups and downs of dating. ​This past weekend, we were catching up, and I was telling her about ""Jane"" a new girl I was really hitting it off with. I was genuinely excited about the possibility of this going somewhere and was just sharing my happiness with my best friend. ​That's when she snapped. ​It was a total 180. Sarah went from being supportive to furious, saying I was ""incredibly dense,"" that I had ""wasted years of her time,"" and that she couldn't believe how clueless I was. I was completely shocked and asked her what on earth she was talking about. ​I finally managed to ask her flat out, ""Sarah, are you saying you have feelings for me?"" ​Her answer wasn't a ""yes."" It was, ""If I have to say it, then you really don't get it, do you? It's been five years! It should have been obvious by now!"" She then stormed out and has been ignoring all my attempts to contact her since. ​I feel absolutely gut-punched. I truly had no idea. In five years, she has never once initiated anything romantic, dropped a clear hint, or even flirted in a way that couldn't be interpreted as just close friendship. We've talked about our future partners, and she's helped me pick out gifts for past dates! ​So, AITJ for treating my best friend like my best friend and talking to her about my dating life, when she apparently expected me to be a mind-reader about feelings she never clearly expressed over the course of five years?"
"NTA. If she didn’t say anything or do anything to indicate she wanted something romantic instead of platonic, you’re not a psychic. However, if she was a dude doing this everyone would be screaming that it’s creepy. Frankly, I think that if she talked about you guys being friends, and you respected her autonomy and treated her like a person you did what most women want you to do. Which is respect them and listen to what they say.  So don’t let her gaslight you into thinking pretending to be your friend for five years while really wanting to date you is OK. It’s not. She took away your agency by lying to you about what her intentions were. If she handled her shit, you would either continue to be really good friends or you might date but now how could you trust her with anything?  If you want to send her one more text, go ahead but stop chasing her, you should be ghosting her. Say something to the effect of “I’m sorry I hurt your feelings by respecting the boundaries of friendship. blah blah blah” I know sometimes people think stuff like this is romantic, but I really don’t. I’ve been on the receiving end of a speech like your friend too much by someone “who put in the time“ and felt like they were entitled to me."
" NTA. If, even when looking back now that you know, you can't see where she showed feelings beyond close friendship, then she wasn't being even sort of clear. She clearly hid her feelings behind the friendship while making it clear she supported you dating other people, and then expected you to read her mind? It doesn't work like that. Most guys will miss subtle hints, they need something clearer than that, but Sarah wasn't even giving you subtle hints.  The reason you never suspected this was anything but a close friendship with your best platonic friend is because Sarah acted like you were only platonic. There was nothing there to make you think otherwise, Sarah made sure of that.  She doesn't get to be mad at you for not realising she liked you as more than a friend when she went out of her way to hide that fact from you.  Sarah sounds like the female equivalent of those men who get 'friendzoned' but stick around hoping for a chance to have sex with a woman, then get mad at the woman for clearly expressing they're just friends and have never shown an interest beyond that. The type of guy that feels entitled to sex from a woman just because he's been 'friends' with her for years, that's Sarah, just the female version of those guys.  You did nothing wrong, but Sarah secretly called dibs on you a long time ago and is now mad you didn't magically fall in love with a person who made it clear you were just friends."
"So, my ex-friend, whom I will call Vanessa, had a situation a couple of days ago. I got my phone taken away for having a YouTube channel (just for fun). I never showed my face, but I did discuss my sexuality and identity (I am pansexual and a demi-girl).  Vanessa also had a YouTube channel, but when her mom found out about it, Vanessa told her that I had suggested she start one and that I had given her my channel. At that time, I hadn’t come out to my mom yet, and she took my phone away. Vanessa’s mom also took her phone away.  Before her mom took her phone, I told Vanessa that I didn’t want to be friends with her because she had outed me. She didn’t respond, but now we have school tomorrow, and I have to break the news to all my friends that I no longer have a phone and that I am no longer friends with Vanessa. If anyone thinks I’m secretive, it's because I can’t talk to my mom about ANYTHING.  UPDATE: I just got back from school and told Vanessa that I wasn’t friends with her anymore. We got into a big argument. She insisted that I was the one who suggested she start a channel, a"
" Nothing exotic going on. Th
is is just crowded positioning unwinding. When everyone is leaning into the same AI and tech names, it does not take big news for things to move together.  Premarket always exaggerates moves too. Lower liquidity means small flows look like big drops. Once cash market opens, a lot of this either stabilises or partially reverses.  Also worth remembering that big tech being down 3 to 5 percent after a strong run is not a sell off in the historical sense. It just feels worse because everything is red at once and apps push it in your face first thing in the morning.  If you have a long term view, days like this are mostly noise. If you are trading short term, then yeah this is the cost of being in crowded themes.  I have been jotting down my own notes on days like this because it is easy to overreact in the moment. If anyone finds that useful, it is on my profile."
" A little bit different, but my husband has this lovely cousin who is always a breath of fresh air. I don't see her very often so the first time I met her husband was when she had her first baby.  We were talking about the birth and swapping stories. You made some rude remark about our conversation and I said, somewhat rudely back, that women go through a lot during childbirth and we should be allowed to talk about it, and if it made him uncomfortable he could leave.  Needless to say, we've never had another conversation. I'm sure he thinks I'm a bitch, but I have no use for a man like that. He very well could be very nice, but I guess I'll never know lol.  My daughter told me she passed a pad to her friend in class and the (male) teacher told her it wasn't appropriate. She retorted with ""Half the world gets periods, I'm not sure why you find what our bodies do inappropriate.""  I was proud of her for being so open in the first place, and putting the guy in his place.  All this to say, I am definitely sick of tolerating men who are squeamish about a woman's natural bodily functions. If we had our way, we certainly would not go through any of this in the first place."
"What the fuck kind of pompous, puffed-up, 18th-century, rural Lette Ye Manne Be Ye Parsonne Of Ye Goodly Home wannabe redpill bollocks is this?  ‘Not appropriate at the table’ - why? Literally, there is no other reason to keep it from the table unless he is implying it turns his stomach? Disgusts him? To the point where he can’t eat? Birth control? Really???  And you know what else? The guy complains now about the public embarrassment of an interpersonal schism in front of your sister, when it was him that chose to ‘in an annoyed tone’ and very publicly shame your sister.  He had a choice, whether to be a bully or not. He could have chosen to let her talk. To be cool about it. To be a grownup. To be kind and tolerant. He chose public shaming. You just stuck up for your sister.  Honestly, good for you. Good for your sister. As for this pompous tragicomic authority character out of a fucking Charles Dickens novel, this Mr fucking Bumble The Beadle-ass windbag and coward you’re romantically involved with, can you get it removed?"
