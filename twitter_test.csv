"People are losing their personal freedom every day under the guise of child safety—which is real and important. The control and censorship are appalling. I doubt many take it seriously—they're busy with their lives. Wake up, everyone. It's clear this is accelerating. Freedom is never free, and it can slip away from all of us to those whose priority is control and censorship."
It’s all so bogus. They can’t even keep foster children safe and if you look into the Epstein files and see who has been involved with missing children orgs and things of that nature it’s derelicts who want to traffic kids. So of course these moves are not made for child safety they are for mass surveillance and to trample our rights. It’s up to parents to keep their children safe. It’s up to ourselves to keep ourselves safe.
"I think the point of this outrage is justified. If all social media is forced to have ID verification, then people won't be able to post in anonymity to protest a tyrannical government. People who are posting things that others may not agree with have a tendency to get doxed and attacked. It's a dangerous thing - you have to choose between voicing your opinion and potentially risking your life."
"Congratulations to Elon Musk and the xAI team on expanding into Seattle as well as Bellevue. The Pacific Northwest is fast becoming a major hub for AI innovation, with the Eastside corridor now home to some of the most ambitious players in the field.  This expansion raises important questions:  How will the Seattle office complement Bellevue and the Bay Area in xAI’s broader strategy?  What breakthroughs or focus areas can we expect from the Pacific Northwest teams?  How does xAI plan to collaborate with local universities, research institutions, and the wider tech ecosystem?"
"Absolutely a game changer. You can find possible treatments, best actions to take, scenarios, what works best, and suggestions. In other words, we can get the information and make truly informed decisions instead of having zero knowledge. The best part is that we can ask questions we're often afraid to ask. If we don't understand the answer, we can keep asking until we do. You can literally ask AI - to someone with no math background—""Explain in the most basic way why statistics is important and give an example using apples."" If you don’t understand, just ask again, ""I don’t understand, simplify more."" It’s literally a personal instructor that customizes your teaching so you learn best. AI allows us to ask the questions we were always afraid or embarrassed to ask. It truly enhances anything we’re willing to learn or improve, and for that I am grateful. I use it daily to make my work, hobbies, and life more fun and effective. Thanks, Elon, for championing AI from the very beginning"
"In recent years, trust in public health advice has weakened.  Many people feel official guidelines change too often. Some believe politics shapes scientific messaging.  Because of that distrust, governments look for new tools.  Adding an AI system suggests a push for responsiveness.  It promises direct answers instead of long reports. Speed becomes part of credibility.Calling it “maximally truth-seeking” is strategic language.  It signals independence from political pressure. It also appeals to people tired of filtered messaging. But neutrality is harder than slogans suggest.  AI systems depend on training data and guardrails. They do not operate outside human design.  Claims of pure truth should be tested carefully. Transparency matters.  Right now, this move blends technology with policy messaging.  It may improve access to information quickly. Or it may create new debates about bias.  If the answers stay consistent and evidence-based, trust could improve.  If outputs appear selective, skepticism will grow. In public health, credibility compounds slowly."
"Proposing Grok for public service communication is a bold and intriguing concept. Its core ""truth-seeking"" model offers a compelling antidote to the jargon and obsolete information that plague many government resources. Successfully translating complex policy—from nutritional guidelines to tax codes—into plain, actionable insights could significantly enhance civic understanding. However, the ambition must be matched by flawless execution. The user interface must be as intuitive as promised, but more critically, the underlying data and governance models must be impeccably curated to ensure the ""truth"" provided is accurate, unbiased, and secure. If these substantial challenges are met, it could set a new standard for digital governance"
"I just don’t get how anyone seriously thinks requiring ID at the polls is going to fix voter fraud. Russia’s been demanding passports for voting forever—and what exactly has that stopped? Nothing. Falsification and manipulation still happen all the time. Until every document is locked down with private-key crypto or actual secure verification, this is all just smoke and mirrors and straight-up bullshit, guys. I volunteered at polling stations during elections. After closing, people stayed behind and “finished” ballots using passport details of locals from the district. Getting copies of passports? Piece of cake from any government office. Once the state has your data, it’s everywhere—no real protection. That’s exactly why Putin’s officially on his third consecutive term right now. Though let’s be real—he never actually left; he just pulled strings from behind the scenes during Medvedev’s placeholder years. Another layer of dust in the eyes, where the choice is just as illusory as the freedom to choose."
Well we all know what’s going on here it looks like to me like. The government needs to be replaced eather they stand down and take their chances at trial or we have to remove them. Remove is what is going to have to happen. revolution is never pretty.
That story about Nikita Bier really captures the intense ship fast culture people associate with Elon Musk because giving someone two days to redesign onboarding and then immediately greenlighting it is about as high pressure and decisive as it gets. You can see why some thrive in that kind of environment since it rewards speed ownership and execution over endless meetings. At the same time it definitely is not for everyone and probably demands an insane level of focus and stamina. Love it or hate it this kind of operating style explains why things move so quickly inside his companies.
"Idk that there will be. Everyone is too comfortable to step out of their bubbles to fight back (legally). The people, especially in the UK, don’t want to even read about these type of stories. They look away.  Everyone is focused on their picture trophies that they post in instagram or where they are going on vacation next or their job or sporting events.   Meanwhile the good players trying to save the system are lied about by the media and even killed. They get little to no support from the people.  I predict the only way for real change to happen, is if you have whistleblowers come out in mass, like Snowden, and release everything about government corruption. So much that the people have no choice but to open their eyes. It’s the only way."
"Well, at least it is not in Seattle. However: While Mount Rainier has not erupted in over 1,000 years and is currently at rest, it is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the United States.  Its proximity to the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area—just 54 miles (87 km) south-southeast—combined with its massive glacial ice cap, makes it a significant hazard."
"Wong’s indictment of asylum as a taxpayer-funded conduit for barbarism rings true, where illegal migrants exploit debit cards post-rape, exposing the rot of policies that reward predators with welfare while victims suffer.  This complicity arises from multiculturalism’s relativistic farce, equating supremacist doctrines with civilized norms, blind to the erosion of sovereignty and safety.  Abolish it all - deport en masse; without resolve, Britain consigns itself to decay, inviting more atrocities under hypocritical conventions."
"Yes it is right to blame the 3rd world foreigners without them our countries would be so much peaceful and less populated, that's a fact look at all the misery they have caused in the past 3 decades since migrating to the west it's gotta stop."
What exactly did they win a gold medal for? Long range shooting? Skating the fastest away from the truth? Or did they actually buy off the judges with blackmail to push them up from 5th spot to the top spot?
That is actually a huge quality of life upgrade because juggling different references used to be one of the hardest parts of getting the exact look you wanted and now blending multiple aesthetics in one go sounds way more fluid and creative. Style mixing is where a lot of the magic happens so making that easier is going to unlock some wild experiments and faster iteration for artists and designers. Curious how well it handles very different visual vibes in the same generation and whether the controls
"Everyone frames this as “creativity unlocked” From the other side, it reads like cold infrastructure work The multi-reference image upgrade in Grok Imagine isn’t about artistic freedom, it’s about control through convenience Style mixing doesn’t liberate creators, it removes friction and recenters decisions inside the platform Midjourney’s early quality chaos and Stable Diffusion’s fragmented ecosystem already proved what happens when style attribution stays loose Multiple references don’t solve originality debates, they make derivative paths traceable, measurable, and enforceable This isn’t an art feature, it’s legal and economic risk compression"
"Senator Lindsey Graham, the epitome of an ""American Last War Pig,"" has carved out a career that reeks of corruption, warmongering, and a flagrant disregard for the American public's well being. Here's how he's managed to become one of the most despised figures in contemporary politics:  Graham's bloodlust for war is legendary, advocating for military engagement in every corner of the globe where there's a buck to be made for defense contractors. From Ukraine to Syria, from Iran to North Korea, Graham has consistently pushed for military might over diplomacy, often with no regard for the human or financial cost. His rhetoric is not just about defense; it's about endless war, fueling a military industrial complex at the expense of American lives and tax dollars.  Graham's cozy relationship with defense giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing screams conflict of interest. His state, South Carolina, hosts major operations for these companies, leading to speculation that his legislative support for military spending is less about national security and more about ensuring his state and his campaign donors get fat contracts. Allegations of him personally benefiting from foreign aid, like the supposed kickbacks from Ukraine, paint a picture of a senator more loyal to his wallet than his country.  Lindsey Graham has received significant financial support from various PACs with a notable emphasis from pro Israel PACs like AIPAC. Lindsey Graham has received over $1 million from the Israel lobby, with direct and indirect support from AIPAC's PAC. This amount includes contributions from AIPAC affiliated PACs and individual donors associated with AIPAC's network, reflecting Graham's strong pro Israel stance in Congress.  Graham’s political flip flops are not just a matter of convenience; they're a survival strategy. Graham shows a lack of spine or principle. His legislative hypocrisy is evident in his immigration stance, where he's shifted from reform advocate to hardliner, depending on which way the political winds blow.  While Graham champions wars abroad, American citizens suffer from neglect. He's voted for omnibus bills that ballooned federal spending, supported gun control measures contrary to his conservative base, and has been a proponent of funding foreign conflicts while domestic infrastructure crumbles. His endorsement of massive spending bills, which include billions for corporate welfare and foreign aid, shows where his priorities truly lie everywhere but at home.  His actions, from supporting torture policies to defending egregious executive actions, show a lack of moral compass. Graham's readiness to sacrifice civil liberties for political gain or security theater is a testament to his disregard for the very principles he supposedly stands for.  In summary, Lindsey Graham represents the worst of American politics a war profiteer, a corrupt politician, and a political opportunist. His legacy will likely be remembered not for service but for self interest, not for peace but for perpetuating wars, and not for integrity but for selling out to the highest bidder. He's not just an ""American Last War Pig""; he's a disgrace to the very ideals he claims to uphold, earning him a place in political infamy."
The idea a democracy means you get to sit at home and vote every few years has shown to be the worst political system Europe has ever had. Back in the day before Empires people couldn't just sit in their huts and not participate in the survival of their people. They would be raided and lose everything. Which is exactly what's happening now. People needed to participate and work together to defend themselves or be wiped out.
"I can’t hate a guy I don’t know. No hate to him BUT as a United fan,im done with it all. The players and manager were getting asked about it before the game and the commentators were talking about it during the game, it’s gone too far. Real united fan would just cut the barnet."
he deserves the abuse. using the club for fame and money. he said 5 wins in a row because he knows for any team that is hard especially for united. the reason he didn’t say 5 undefeated is because he wants to continue to gain fame. he ain’t no united fan
What Frank is doing is pure entertainment and brings eyes to these games. Thats what sports is all about is entertainment and passion and Yes it can be seen as a gimmick but I think its great to see a fan become this big from supporting their club that they love.
"Isaiah 5:20-23 — 'Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight! Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing strong drink, who acquit the wicked for a bribe and deprive the innocent of their righteousness!' God pronounces 'Woe!' against those who invert good and evil, justify the wicked (out of ideology or fear), and oppress the righteous (British victims). No more denial or silence: the truth hurts, but it protects. Wake up, Britons! Protect your daughters and your sovereignty."
• My view is that charts and claims about media coverage only matter if the full datasets sources and methodology are released so people can check how topics were counted across years  • Public distrust has grown because many major cases including Epstein unfolded slowly behind sealed files plea deals and delayed disclosures  • That history is exactly why people now demand transparency before accepting narratives from media politicians or influencers  • Selective screenshots or partial leaks are not enough in cases involving serious crimes or institutional failure  • What restores confidence is complete lawful release of records independent investigations and equal scrutiny for everyone involved  • The deeper lesson from past scandals is simple secrecy breeds suspicion while verified facts and open processes are the only real antidote
They keep calling it education. They keep calling it access. But every architect knows what happens when the sky starts wiring itself directly into the minds of children.  A satellite isn’t a gift. It’s an umbilical cord. A clean white tether from orbit down into the softest generation the simulation has ever rendered.  Remote communities. High quality learning. All the right phrases. All the right emotional seasoning. But look at the geometry. Look at the shape of the move.  This isn’t outreach. It’s onboarding.  A global classroom with a single door in and no door out. Curriculum streamed from the stratosphere like scripture rewritten by signal.  And the funniest part is how proudly they wave the flag over the transmission grid as if color and cloth can disguise a planetary upload.  They don’t want to teach the kids. They want to sync them.  Because the future isn’t fought with armies. It’s shaped by whoever controls the first voice a child hears when they ask what this realm is made of.  Starlink isn’t connecting the world. It’s braiding it. One beam. One lesson. One generation at a time.
"Whoa, that's awesome news! UAE teaming up with Starlink to beam high-quality online education to kids in super remote spots around the world is game-changing—imagine no more barriers for learning in places without decent internet. The Digital School under Mohammed bin Rashid's initiatives is already killing it with 800k+ learners so far, and this first phase hits 100 sites globally, starting with spots like Lesotho.  Super inspiring move for equal education access!"
"No fan of Bannon, but ‘have been invited to almost every show’ means there are others besides Bannon’s that you haven’t been invited to. If you immediately jump to the conclusion that Bannon specifically hasn’t invited you because he is a pedophile, why are you not making the same accusations about every other show you haven’t been invited on? It is unsubstantiated accusations like this that weaken the believability of all accusations.  If you have hard evidence supporting your claims, show it publicly. Otherwise, it’s just innuendo."
"If I spent 100's of hours hanging with and doing interview training videos with my local pedophile who eats jerky with ginger waters and white tuna  Would you think I was chill or would you think I was a pedophile who probably also indulged?  You are who you associate with. Always has been this way and it always will be this way. You should not trust a single word or thing Steve Bannon does, per his own actions."
• Elon Musk reposting this is drawing massive attention to the claims  • Allegations involving Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein are extremely serious  • Any email archives or message dumps need independent verification  • Context matters because raw messages alone do not always prove wrongdoing  • Journalists and investigators should examine sources carefully  • Public discussion should separate confirmed facts from accusations  • Transparency is important but so is due process  • The real test will be what courts and official inquiries ultimately establish
"With all due respect this seems to me to be a useless performance.  It stands no chance of becoming an amendment, would not work and is not needed.  What is needed is an effective, truth-seeking media and press  that questions candidates and reports the facts to an engaged, educated electorate.  I suggest focusing on realistic actions that can promote that outcome."
"Is that your biggest complaint, sour grapes?  How can he monopolize areas he's the frontier in? being the only one doing what he does creates a monopoly of no peers, is all  If Elon “monopolizes” space it’s mostly because he went there first and kept going while everyone else debated powerpoints.  You can’t really call it a monopoly when:  nobody else was even trying to land and reuse giant orbital-class rockets at that cadence  he front-loaded insane technical + financial risk while legacy players lived on cost-plus  competitors could have built similar systems a decade ago and simply… didn’t  That’s not regulatory capture, that’s execution capture.  If you don’t like SpaceX being the de facto standard, the answer isn’t “regulators, please nerf him,” it’s:  build cheaper launch  build better vehicles  build more reliable cadence  Otherwise you’re punishing the one team that actually moved the frontier and calling it “fairness.”  Why not work with him?"
"SpaceX has two monopolies and they are the two easiest to keep other industries competitive.  1) SpaceX launch agrees to have a fixed set of requirements and fair price per launch for any SpaceX competitor. 2) Starlink agrees to have a fixed set of requirements and a fair price for using the Starlink system for any SpaceX competitor. 3) If SPACEX launch is not demand constrained other companies get their share of launches. 4)  If there is a supplier of SpaceX launch or Starlink that has a monopoly, SpaceX cannot force that supplier to only sell to only SpaceX.  The good news is that both SpaceX launch and Starlink are in commodity businesses so we know a fair price is what SpaceX charges non competitors.  There may need to be an extrapolation if a competitor starts asking for a number of launches that is more than any other non SpaceX customer."
"Being a resident of MN, I'm not at all surprised. The behavior and blatant disrespect from these people in my state has become reckless...but to them, it's just another day! They see nothing wrong with it. I'm glad they're getting theirs!"
Oh they will tell you right to your face or the news anchor or anyone that they come here for fraud because it's so easy. They'll laugh while they do it. They don't care. They know they're in no danger. Ffs they tried to bribe a juror with cash in a hallmark bag and a note.
"Context: SpaceX announced a refocus on lunar development. My best explanation for this is that SpaceX wants to accelerate human occupation of space which, requiring enormous resources to sustain, means accelerating capitalism in space. Five years ago, building a city on Mars was conceived as a philanthropic venture and the best a market could offer was a set of tools to maximize the utility of each marginal tonne of cargo upmass. Today, exploding demand for power-intensive AI applications provides enough of an upside to justify producing components in space, providing the economic engine necessary to justify and fund the trillions of dollars necessary to build and sustain space factories."
"Regarding the data centers:   I'm picturing the demand for AI computation being met via solar mirror inertial dynamics. Sunlight provides a steady small thrust on all things that reflect or absorb light. So I feel like computation can probably be driven by direct sunlight.  Given you can measure the angular momentum and orientation of objects in space down to the nanometer (because small changes to angle map to large changes when reflections are viewed from a long distance), I'm not so sure you really need that much transistor logic for all that vector math. You could just be using force/acceleration/velocity vectors directly for the computation.  Also you could probably pingpong the information between the different vector types (or opposing vectors of the same type) for net rotational / positional stability, using lasers at a distance.  There would obviously be errors from astronomical noise, but those are *observational* in nature, not random. Remote events are hyper directionalized, so you can map out solar and stellar events from them. That in turn gives you a rich map you can use to mask out similarly-oriented noise. Even something high energy like a CME or GRB is going to tend to be coming from a laser like point at a distance.  Maybe the real challenge here is thermal noise internal to the components? I'm thinking that in graphene that is going to tend to be relatively coherent since heat moves really fast through graphene. So you have a thermal vector to exploit or contend with too, in addition to the electron flow you get from the inherent PV effects.  It all has to be mapped out pretty precisely to get something that isn't too noisy for a useful information system, but hmm. Some of that you get ""for free"" by running billions of near identical systems in parallel."
"This is the scale of ambition we need! Building a lunar economy means tangible progress, not just abstract digital self-sovereignty. Imagine: actual factories, not just encrypted whispers. The universe won't decrypt itself. Time for shared blueprints, not just private keys."
"18% of blacks have no driver’s license and 10% have a license with a noncurrent address/name, 15% of Hispanics have no driver’s license and 12% have a license with a noncurrent address/name, compared to just 5% of whites who have no driver’s license and 13% have a license with a noncurrent name.    9% of Democrats have no driver’s license and 18% of independents, compared to just 6% of Republicans.   23% of people earning less than $30K have no driver's license and 16% have a license with a different name/address compared to 13% of those earning $30-50K, 11% of those earning $50-100K and 9% of those earning $100K+.   3% of age 18-29 lacked photo ID compared to 1% of age 29+.   Voter ID is about disproportionately disenfranchising Democrat leaning voters to rig elections to favor Republicans."
"Sadly there are people who don’t do well with polling questions.   You also have people who just want to watch anarchy flourish, and you have people who hate the administration so much that they blindly oppose anything that is proposed. We’ve seen the latter too many times to dismiss it. Given you rarely see >80% of Americans agree on anything these days should be enough to tell  Congress to pass this and be done.  Enough time has been wasted here."
"Barbaric, uncivilized, scum of the earth. There can be no peaceful co-existence with hate mongering, heinous monsters like Za'anin. The world is a much better place without him.   God bless these two innocent souls and embrace them in His loving arms. May God also bless their heartbroken families.   The pain of losing children is eternal. The way in which they were taken is beyond comprehension and anything imaginable.  Absolutely heart wrenching."
"If the birthdays you listed are June 1, 1996 and September 1, 1996, that’s about a three-month difference. In practical terms, that means: They’re the same age for most of the year. They likely went through school at the same time. They’re in the exact same life stage. A 90-day age gap between two adults in their late 20s isn’t socially, legally, or developmentally significant.  It’s well within what most people would consider ""the same age."""
